# info.gg3.dev

**A portal to my infrastructure, served cold over NGINX. One HTML file. One hardened server. A few hidden paths.**

This is the source code for [info.gg3.dev](https://info.gg3.dev), my personal man page-style site. Built entirely in static HTML, it reflects my DevOps philosophy: build what matters, keep it lean, secure the edges.

### ðŸ”§ What's inside
- `index.html` â€“ The main site, styled like a Unix man page
- `favicon.ico` â€“ A pixel-perfect icon for your tab bar
- `jgarcia.cv.pdf` â€“ My resume
- `robots.txt` â€“ Keeps crawlers away from secret paths
- `/secret/` â€“ Terminal-inspired hidden interface (spoilers ahead)

### ðŸ“¡ Hosted on
- Debian (hardened)
- NGINX with strict headers
- Self-hosted in my XCP-ng hypervisor
- Behind pfSense, VLAN-segmented
